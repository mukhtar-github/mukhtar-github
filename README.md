### About

Hi ðŸ‘‹! I am **Mukhtar**, a Mechanical Engineer transformed into a Software Developer. I started my programming journey in the year 2018 as a non-traditional developer with no background in CS. So far, the time metrics have amounted to about 2500 hours on counting.

### Building

As a Fleet Manager at the Organization where I work, the challenge of going through archives to get vehicle information for updates was time-consuming.
As a result of that challenge, the idea of [VIMAP](https://www.vimap.io/), an acronym for _Vehicles Information Management Application,_ came up to provide a solution to replace the hard copies method of saving and updating vehicle information with a simple application to save, access, and update vehicle information. VIMAP is a _fleet wallet._ The software's features are; but are not limited to the Collection and Storage of Vehicles Information, Inventory, GPS tracking, and Insurance updates.
