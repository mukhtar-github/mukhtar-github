### About

Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm **Mukhtar**, a Mechanical Engineer that transitioned into a Software Developer. I started my programming journey in 2018 as a non-traditional developer with no background in Computer Science.

### Building

While working as a Fleet Manager with my employer, there was this challenge of going through archives to get vehicle information for updates which was time-consuming. The challenge gave birth to the idea of [VIMAP](https://vimap.io/), an acronym for _Vehicles Information Management Application_. The software provides a solution to replace the hard copies method of accessing, saving, and updating vehicle information. VIMAP is a _fleet wallet_ for organizations. The software's features are the Collection and Storage of Vehicles Information, Search, Updates, Graphical Data Visualization, and more.
