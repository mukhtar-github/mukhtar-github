### About

Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm **Mukhtar**, a Mechanical Engineer who transitioned into a Software Developer. I started my programming journey in 2018 as a non-traditional developer with no background in Computer Science.

### Building

As a Fleet Manager, one of my biggest challenges was searching through archives to find vehicle information for updates, which was time-consuming and inefficient. That motivated me to create [VIMAP](https://vimap.io/), an acronym for _Vehicles Information Management Application_. VIMAP is a software solution that replaces the traditional hard-copy method of accessing, saving, and updating vehicle information. VIMAP is a _fleet data manager_ designed for organizations, and it offers a range of features, including the ability to collect and store vehicle information and search, update, and visualize data in a graphical format. With VIMAP, managing fleet data has never been easier.
