# About Me

## Mukhtar Garba

### About

I am a Mechanical Engineer who transitioned into Software Development. I started programming in 2018, driven by a passion for creating digital solutions to solve practical problems. As a Fleet Manager, I faced challenges with inefficient vehicle information management processes, leading me to develop **VIMAP** (Vehicle Information Management Application) to streamline fleet data management for organizations.
Currently, I am leading the development of **Taxpoynt,** a SaaS project that is aimed at modernizing tax collection for small businesses in Nigeria by digitizing and simplifying the tax filing process. This project showcases my commitment to leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiency and compliance. I presented a paper at the **ICEGOV 2024** conference in Pretoria, South Africa. The paper (Assessing the Impact of Taxpoynt Platform on Small Business Tax Compliance through Digitization) was published in the ICEGOV Proceedings [ICEGOV '24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3680127.3680143), which covered the impact of **Taxpoynt** in transforming tax compliance for small businesses through digital innovation.
I hold a Masterâ€™s in **Engineering Management** and am proficient in various technologies, including JavaScript, React, and Next.js. My work showcases my technical skills and ability to enhance business processes through the effective use of technology.

### Built VIMAP

As a Fleet Manager, one of my biggest challenges was searching through archives to find vehicle information for updates, which was time-consuming and inefficient. That motivated me to create [VIMAP](https://vimap.io/), an acronym for *Vehicles Information Management Application*. VIMAP is a software solution that replaces the traditional hard-copy method of accessing, saving, and updating vehicle information. VIMAP is a *fleet data manager* designed for organizations, and it offers a range of features, including the ability to collect and store vehicle information and search, update, and visualize data in a graphical format. With VIMAP, managing fleet data has never been easier.

### Built Taxpoynt

Navigating tax compliance is a common challenge for small businesses and individuals, especially when it involves consolidating financial transactions from various sources. This complexity drove me to create [Taxpoynt](https://www.taxpoynt.com/), a robust application that simplifies tax returns through smart, seamless integration with bank transactions. Taxpoynt leverages advanced algorithms to analyze financial data, calculate accurate tax obligations, and generate ready-to-file tax return forms. It's designed to ensure compliance, reduce errors, and save time, making it an indispensable tool for taxpayers seeking a hassle-free tax filing experience. With Taxpoynt, mastering your taxes is just a few clicks away.
